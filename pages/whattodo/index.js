        para="Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released
                under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the
                rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and
                its source code to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source
                software may be developed in a collaborative public manner.
                Open-source software is a prominent example of open
                collaboration, meaning any capable user is able to participate
                online in development, making the number of possible
                contributors indefinite. The ability to examine the code
                facilitates public trust in the software.Open source code can be
                used for studying and allows capable end users to adapt software
                to their personal needs in a similar way user scripts and custom
                style sheets allow for web sites, and eventually publish the
                modification as a fork for users with similar preferences, and
                directly submit possible improvements as pull requests."
